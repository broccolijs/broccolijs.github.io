### So what is Broccoli?

Broccoli is a JavaScript build tool that exposes a simple JavaScript API to perform file-based transformations,
allowing developers to easily build complex build pipelines, using a simple, functional API.

### Why choose Broccoli?

<div class="summary">
    <div>
        <h4>Blazing fast ‚ö°Ô∏è</h4>
        <p>Broccoli's incremental rebuild system gives you sub-second compile times even when you're working with hundreds of files.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Less (code) is more üìâ</h4>
        <p>Broccoli's ecosystem of high-quality plugins means you only have to write a few lines of code for most common tasks.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Flexible ü§∏‚Äç</h4>
        <p>Use Broccoli by itself, or as part of a larger system like Grunt, Rails, ember-cli, or even make. Broccoli doesn't care, it just builds what it's told.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>It's Just JavaScript üôå</h4>
        <p>A Brocfile.js is just an ES6 module ‚Äì use the JavaScript you already know to specify how to build your assets.</p>
    </div>
</div>

Broccoli simply orchestrates file transformations via plugins. Plugins perform the actual work and operate on files,
Broccoli coordinates the inputs and output of plugins.

Broccoli provides a simple, functional JavaScript API for constructing your build pipeline.

### Example pipeline

```js
/* Brocfile.js */

import SassSourceMaps from 'broccoli-sass-source-maps';
import Sass from 'sass';
import babel from 'broccoli-babel-transpiler';
import merge from 'broccoli-merge-trees';

const compileSass = SassSourceMaps(Sass);

const appRoot = 'app';

const styles = compileSass([appRoot], 'styles/app.scss', 'assets/app.css');
const scripts = babel(appRoot);

export default () => merge([styles, scripts]);
```

The above is an example of a simple Broccoli build pipeline that compiles Sass files and transcodes JavaScript using
Babel, then merges the result into an output directory.
